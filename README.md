 Research Vision: Computational Linguistics for Low-Resource Languages

 Abstract
A research initiative focused on addressing the critical gap in Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources and models for Kurdish, Laki, and Arabic dialects. This portfolio outlines a proposed PhD research direction inspired by the bias mitigation and fairness work of researchers like Professor Yulia Tsvetkov, aiming to bring computational linguistic equity to underserved Iranian and Arabic language communities.

 Research Problem & Motivation
Large language models (LLMs) and NLP technologies exhibit significant performance disparities and inherent biases when applied to low-resource languages. This creates a "digital divide," excluding communities like Kurdish, Laki, and specific Arabic dialects from the benefits of modern AI. My work is motivated by the goal of linguistic justice and the preservation of cultural heritage through technology.

 Proposed Research Directions

 1. Bias Measurement and Mitigation for Iranian Languages
Goal: Adapt and develop frameworks for quantifying social and representational biases in LLMs against Kurdish and Laki.
Methodology: Leverage methodologies from fairness-in-NLP literature to create evaluation datasets and benchmark model performance.

 2. Morphological Modeling for Rich Morphology Languages
Goal: Develop robust morphological analyzers and disambiguators for Kurdish and Laki, which possess complex and rich morphological structures.
Methodology: Explore hybrid models combining finite-state transducers (FSTs) with neural sequence-to-sequence models.

 3. Resource Development for Arabic Dialects
Goal: Create foundational resources (e.g., annotated corpora, lexicons) for under-represented Arabic dialects, building upon my formal BA in Arabic Language & Literature.
Methodology: Collaborate with native speaker communities for data collection and annotation.

 Technical Skills & Preparation
Programming: Python (Currently enhancing skills)
NLP Libraries: Familiarizing with NLTK, spaCy
Linguistic Assets: Native proficiency in Persian, Kurdish, Laki; Advanced proficiency in Modern Standard Arabic and Gulf dialects.
